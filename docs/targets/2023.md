# Targets 2023

1. Learn dinghy sailing to be confident in small lakes like [Erlichsee](../trips/2023-06-09-erlichsee.md). :white_check_mark:

2. Try bigger lakes with other boats. Compare with other inflatables. For example at the [inflatable boats meeting](../trips/2023-06-03-altmuehlsee.md). :white_check_mark:

3. Do 3 international trips: Geneve Lake (Switzerland-France), Lago-Maggiore (Italy-France), Bodensee (Switzerland-Austria-Germany).

4. Try Neckar River sailing (especially against the current).

5. Spend one week in the apartments with a direct access to the sea, to have a possibility of every day sailing (or rowing if no wind).
