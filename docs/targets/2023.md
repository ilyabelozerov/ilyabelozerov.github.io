# Targets 2023

1. Learn dinghy sailing to be confident in small lakes like [Erlichsee](../trips/2023-06-09-erlichsee.md). :white_check_mark:

2. Try bigger lakes with other boats. Compare with other inflatables. For example at the [inflatable boats meeting](../trips/2023-06-03-altmuehlsee.md). :white_check_mark:

3. Do 3 international trips: Geneve Lake (Switzerland-France), Lago-Maggiore (Italy-France), Bodensee (Switzerland-Austria-Germany).

4. Try Neckar River sailing (especially against the current).

5. Spend one week in the apartments with a direct access to the sea, to have a possibility of every day sailing (or rowing if no wind).

## Results

So almost all goals were missed. I haven't been to an "international" lake. Even though I have an [international license](../boat/registration.md), I couldn't find the time to travel.

The river Neckar wasn't on my plan either, because I couldn't steer the boat properly. But at least I tried to go down the river with my SUP board. So at least I know the aquatory now.

I've also traveled to Switzerland, [Lake Lucerne](../trips/2023-10-09-luzerner-see.md). It was a nice trip to try out my [new engine](../boat/e-motor.md). Now I'm much better prepared for [next years](./current.md).
