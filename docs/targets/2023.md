# Targets 2023

I decided to set the goals for every year of the possession of my DinghyGo boat. For the year 2023:

1. Learn dinghy sailing to be confident in small lakes like [Erlichsee](../planned/lake-erlichsee.md).

2. Try bigger lakes with other boats. Compare with other inflatables. For example at the [inflatable boats meeting](https://www.atsc1970.de/schlauchkattreffen/).

3. Do 3 international trips: Geneve Lake (Switzerland-France), Lago-Maggiore (Italy-France), Bodensee (Switzerland-Austria-Germany).

4. Try Neckar River sailing (especially against the current).

5. Spend one week in the apartments with a direct access to the sea, to have a possibility of every day sailing (or rowing if no wind).
